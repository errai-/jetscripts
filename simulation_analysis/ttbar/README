Various scripts for TTBar analysis.

TTBar:

Ideal ttbar analysis, done as if we knew the neutrino properties.

Also for MET the pz is substituted with the neutrino pz.
As far as we know this is the best choice we can make -> the goal.

Inv_ttbar:

Only use the MET transverse information and try to reconstruct other
stuffs.

Stack_ttbar:

A basic stack-plot thingie for ttbar events.
