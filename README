README updated 29.4.2015

This is a collection of data analysis and simulation tools used with the CMS
project. Developed under Helsinki Institute of Physics, which contributes to
the CMS project.

data_analysis:
Tools for analyzing CMS jet data. Aim is to conveniently and quickly make plots
of different aspects.
Last updates in autumn 2014

jet_simulations:
Simulation tools for generating particle data with pythia6, pythia8 and
Herwig++. A common jet sorting algorithm to turn the particle data into jet
data.
Currently actively developed.

simulation_analysis:
A collection of scripts for turning simulated jet data into various plots.
Mostly not compatible with the newest versions of the simulations, these are to
be updated.
Last updates in December 2014

useful_structures:
A collection of useful small scripts and old code versions, which may come in
handy in certain circumstances.
Updated occasionally, files remain mostly static after they are added here.
