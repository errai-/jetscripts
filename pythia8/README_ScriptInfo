Pythia location should be given in ../config.mk. In general, these programs should be run under pythia8/wrkdir (or some similar folder). Makefile should be modified so that fastjet location is taken into account in the CXXFLAGS. Additionally, it is instructive to have a working root installation, as well as fastjet and pythia (also the proper modifications should be done to .bashrc).

Scripts relevant for pythia8-fastjet -simulations:
-------------------------------------------------

jetsorter.cc:
A Pythia simulation that uses fastjet jet clustering and ROOT for storaging the obtained data to a .root file. The usage of these results is general jet data analysis for pythia; for instance particle energy fractions and comparing quark and gluon jets.

jetsorter_auxiliary.h:
Holds all the auxiliary classes and scripts used by jetsorter.

runSortedJetsDistr.C:
A script which uses the sortedjet.root file (created by jetsorter.cc). This particular script shows distributions of different parameters for quark and gluon jets.

runSortedJets.C:
From sortedjet.root, plot jet energy fractions. A custom particle partition.

runPFSortedJets.C:
Same ase runSortedJets, but plots the fractions in PFJet-order/style.

Scripts used for detector simulation:
------------------------------------

ptcut.cc:
A class for simulating the pT-observed/pT-actual fraction in the detectors. This is the oldest/most basic version of the script, using old ECAL and HCAL efficiencies.

ptcut_progressive.cc
A newer version of ptcut. This version uses a new efficiency for HCAL and none for ECAL. Additionally, there is a calo -option present, for accounting the effects also for charged hadrons.

ptcut_stable.cc
An even newer version of ptcut. The aim is to conserve jets, that is clustering is done only once and the scaling is one afterwards.

ptcut_stable_sum.cc
Same as ptcut_stable, but uses the fraction of averages, not the average of fraction

ptcut_datahists.cc
From ptcut_stable, uses histogram information for hadrons to evaluate the hadron response.

drawSamePtCut.C:
A script which uses the ptcut.root file (created by ptcut.cc). This particular scripts plots fractions of simulated pT/real pT fractions for different biases.

drawPtCut.C:
A script which uses the ptcut.root file. Otherwise similar as drawSamePtCut.C, but the Same -version plots everything into a single graph, this plots four different graphs

General pythia8 event generation:
--------------------------------

event2tree.cc:
Make a root file similar to the one produced by real data and CMSSW simulations.

Finalize.C:
A root script that is used for finalizing the process of making files of the desired kind.

FormatHelper.h:
Another pile of scripts needed for the process

Random:
------

tdrStyle_mod*.C:
Slightly different compositions of scripts for making various things for root graphics. The header usually describes, which class uses which tdrStyle.

Auxiliary.C:
A small helper script for root graphics etc.

LoadModules.C:
Very simple help script for root.
