INTRO:

This software collection is designed for simulating collisions at the LHC, 
saving the particle data and processing it to suitable jet data. Simulations are
executed with pythia6/8 or Herwig++.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

SETUP:

make sure that ROOT, pythia8 and herwig++ & ThePEG are correctly installed. These scripts
are working with ROOT 5.34, ROOT 6 is still problematic with the simulators. Make
changes into config.mk according to system specific settings. The software should
be installed in a path defined in a generic path (e.g. /usr/local) that is considered
in LD_LIBRARY_PATH. With root, also the handling with thisroot.sh is sufficient.

IMPORTANT (general):
Either run this every time before starting running or add this to .bashr or
similar (in the latter case $PWD has to be replaced with the path to the current
folder):
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PWD/lib

IMPORTANT (pythia6):
Do the same as above but for pythia6 libraries:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:pythia6libdir

Folder contents:

// pythia8: The files used for pythia8 simulations.

Usage:
 make pythia8
 ./pythia8.exe (number of events) (save file name) (setting file name)

// herwig: The files used for herwig simulations.

Usage:
 make herwig_read HFILE=(read file name)
 make herwig_run NUM=(number of events) HFILE=(run file name)

// pythia6: The files used for pythia6 simulations.
Usage:
 make pythia6

// jetsorting: The programs used for jet sorting and storaging.

Notes:
 rootjetsor and ptcut are in principle functional, but these are to be 
 combined and updated into a similar file as jetanalysis.

Usage:
 make jetanalysis
 ./jetanalysis.exe (mode of operation) (read file name) (save file name)

// events: Event classes used for storaging data.

Notes:
 These are used automatically by the different programs.

 PrtclEvent should be edited only in extreme cases, since the particle data
 itself consumes massive amounts of space. Other events can be modified more
 lightly. If modifications are to be made, the appropriate branches and data
 variables should be created. Also care should be taken with the programs that
 use the results.

Usage:
 The events-folder is portable and can be easily shared. Thus, running
 '.L events/***Event.cpp+' allows to easily load the libraries needed for
 showing different functions present in the event.

// obj, lib: Objects, libraries etc. needed while building the programs.

// generic: Some generic files and programs that don't fit elsewhere.
