////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

INTRO:

This software collection is designed for simulating collisions at the LHC, 
saving the particle data and processing it to suitable jet data. Simulations are
executed with pythia6/8 or Herwig++.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

USED STATUS CODES:

1: Generic final particles

2: For gamma/Z-jets the stable gammas and Z's, for generic gammas originating from pi0

3: Outgoing hardest subprocess

4: Ghost partons
5: Ghost s hadron
6: Ghost c hadron
7: Ghost b hadron
8: Ghost t hadron (reserved for future usage)

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

SETUP:

See installation instructions from the parent folder. ROOT is needed always, and
pythia8 is good to be installed. Pythia6 and Herwig++ are more optional. As of now,
the installation used ROOT 6. This should be compatible with the latest ROOT 5
versions, but there can emerge problems.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

PYTHIA8: The files used for pythia8 simulations.

Build:
 make pythia8
Run:
 make run_pythia8 NUM_EVT=NNNNN NUM_PROC=X MODE=Y
Note:
 All the parameters are optional, since they are initialized with some reasonable values.
 MODE can be set to 0: generic, 1: dijet, 2: gammajet, 3: Zjet

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

HERWIG++: The files used for herwig simulations.

Build:
 make herwig_read HFILE=(read file name)
Run:
 make run_herwig NUM_EVT=NNNNN NUM_PROC=X MODE=Y HFILE=FFFFF
Note:
 HFILE tells which initial setup is used for Herwig++. This has a good initial value and
 usually does not need to be changed. MODE can be set to 0: generic.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

PYTHIA6: The files used for pythia6 simulations.
Buld:
 make pythia6
Run:
 make run_pythia6 NUM_EVT=NNNNN NUM_PROC=X MODE=Y
Note:
 MODE can be set to 0: generic

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// jetsorting: The programs used for jet sorting and storaging.

Notes:
 rootjetsort and ptcut are in principle functional, but these are to be 
 combined and updated into a similar file as jetanalysis.

Usage:
 make jetanalysis
 ./jetanalysis.exe (mode of operation) (read file name) (save file name)

// events: Event classes used for storaging data.

Notes:
 These are used automatically by the different programs.

 PrtclEvent should be edited only in extreme cases, since the particle data
 itself consumes massive amounts of space. Other events can be modified more
 lightly. If modifications are to be made, the appropriate branches and data
 variables should be created. Also care should be taken with the programs that
 use the results.

Usage:
 The events-folder is portable and can be easily shared. Thus, running
 '.L events/***Event.cpp+' allows to easily load the libraries needed for
 showing different functions present in the event.

// obj, lib: Objects, libraries etc. needed while building the programs.

// generic: Some generic files and programs that don't fit elsewhere.
