Testing how writing to trees works with pythia8. It is possible to create 
trees easily, but on the other hand it's very difficult to read trees while
using fastjet. The progress is stalled.

parts2tree.cc creates a tree using the MinimalEvent event definition.

the other classes are attempts of reading running jetsorting algorithms on
the generated data.
