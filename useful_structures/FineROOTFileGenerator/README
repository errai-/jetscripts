At the moment this is more of a curiosity. A "standard" root file is generated
from pythia8 output.

USAGE:

make event2tree
# event2tree.exe is created
./event2tree.exe
# pythiajets.root is created
root -l Finalize.C
# See the file for further options. pythiajets.root is processed
# further, output is of the desired format: .root. 
# Auxiliary.C is used for fine tuning by the script.
# output file: fjpythia.root
# LoadModules.C and FormatHelper.h are not currently in use.
