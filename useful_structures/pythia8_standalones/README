10-02-2015 The contents of this directory are from an older branch and
simulation scripts are now being moved to simulation_analysis. Since
there might be some trouble with moving to the new versions, the old
code is still mostly provided here.

This README describes to some degree the contents of this folder

# Root path and libraries:

Contents below are deprecated and should be used only if some additional information is necessary. New README's are provided in the subfolders.

Pythia location should be given in ../config.mk. In general, these programs should be run under pythia8/wrkdir (or some similar folder). Makefile should be modified so that fastjet location is taken into account in the CXXFLAGS. Additionally, it is instructive to have a working root installation, as well as fastjet and pythia (also the proper modifications should be done to .bashrc).

Scripts relevant for pythia8-fastjet -simulations:
-------------------------------------------------

jetsorter.cc:
A Pythia simulation that uses fastjet jet clustering and ROOT for storaging the obtained data to a .root file. The usage of these results is general jet data analysis for pythia; for instance particle energy fractions and comparing quark and gluon jets.

jetsorter_auxiliary.h:
Holds all the auxiliary classes and scripts used by jetsorter.

runSortedJetsDistr.C:
A script which uses the sortedjet.root file (created by jetsorter.cc). This particular script shows distributions of different parameters for quark and gluon jets.

runSortedJets.C:
From sortedjet.root, plot jet energy fractions. A custom particle partition.

runPFSortedJets.C:
Same ase runSortedJets, but plots the fractions in PFJet-order/style.

Scripts used for detector simulation:
------------------------------------

ptcut.cc:
A class for simulating the pT-observed/pT-actual fraction in the detectors. This is the oldest/most basic version of the script, using old ECAL and HCAL efficiencies.

ptcut_progressive.cc
A newer version of ptcut. This version uses a new efficiency for HCAL and none for ECAL. Additionally, there is a calo -option present, for accounting the effects also for charged hadrons.

ptcut_stable.cc
An even newer version of ptcut. The aim is to conserve jets, that is clustering is done only once and the scaling is one afterwards.

ptcut_stable_sum.cc
Same as ptcut_stable, but uses the fraction of averages, not the average of fraction

ptcut_datahists.cc
From ptcut_stable, uses histogram information for hadrons to evaluate the hadron response.

drawSamePtCut.C:
A script which uses the ptcut.root file (created by ptcut.cc). This particular scripts plots fractions of simulated pT/real pT fractions for different biases.

drawPtCut.C:
A script which uses the ptcut.root file. Otherwise similar as drawSamePtCut.C, but the Same -version plots everything into a single graph, this plots four different graphs

General pythia8 event generation:
--------------------------------

event2tree.cc:
Make a root file similar to the one produced by real data and CMSSW simulations.

Finalize.C:
A root script that is used for finalizing the process of making files of the desired kind.

FormatHelper.h:
Another pile of scripts needed for the process

Random:
------

tdrStyle_mod*.C:
Slightly different compositions of scripts for making various things for root graphics. The header usually describes, which class uses which tdrStyle.

Auxiliary.C:
A small helper script for root graphics etc.

LoadModules.C:
Very simple help script for root.
