Simulation code for CMS detector simulation with pythia8. Multiple versions are
used for historical reasons. A star (*) is used to mark old/deprecated versions.

ptcut: *
The original version. Pairs up jets by location. That is, jets are sorted for
both the "real data" and simulated detector data. These jets are paired up
and compared to each other (direction is used for pairing). This is slightly
inaccurate, since the jet boundaries may vary a bit.

ptcut_progressive: *
A refined version of the original. The basic mechanisms are unchanged.

ptcut_stable.cc:
The best "classic" version of the simulation. Now, only one jet is used
and the energy scales are directly applied to particles.

ptcut_stable_summation.cc: *
Similar as ptcut_stable, but a different summation method is used for
averaging. Turns out, this has little effect on things. ptcut_stable
is thus preferred.

ptcut_datahists:
From ptcut_stable, uses histograms to apply different scales directly
to the particles. The best version at this moment.

USAGE:

make ptcut_*
## ptcut_*.exe is created
./ptcut_*.exe [NoOfEvents]
## ptcut*.root created

CINT files, with *.C (vs. *.cc used by the makefile):
(run these with 'root -l *.C+' or similar commands)

PLOTTING:

drawCaloPtCut.C:
Used to draw hadron effects applied to ECAL vs. effects applied
to both ECAL and HCAL.

drawEfracsPtCut.C:
Used for drawing energy fractions of different particle types in
a simulation.

drawHistsPtCut.C:
Draws pt_simulated/pt_total for a root file created by datahists.
In the root file there would exists also other partitions, which
are not used by this software.

drawProgressivePtCut.C:
A plotting script to show many effects at the same time.

drawPtCut.C: *
First version of PtCut plotting, not compatible with new root files.

drawSamePtCut.C: *
A version of drawPtCut which can swap quickly between two input files.
No other special functionalities.

OTHERS:

pfhadrons.C:
Used to extract information from pfhadrons.root, original script.

saveFits.C:
A modified version to extract the information.

tdrStyle*:
For plotting purposes.
