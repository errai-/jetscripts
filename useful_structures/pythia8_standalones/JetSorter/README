A folder for general jet sorting scenarios with pythia8. The main program 
consists of jetsorter.cc and jetsorter_auxiliary.h.

USAGE:

## In ideal conditions, install pythia8 and jetsorter under /usr/local and
## configure root correctly (thisroot.sh has to be added as a 'source').
## In other cases, the makefile will require some editing.

make jetsorter
## jetsorter.exe is created

./jetsorter.exe [NoOfEvents]
## sortedjets.root is created. If such a file already exists, the old
## version is overwritten. It is advicable to save important runs with
## another name. However, sortedjets.root is the default filename used
## by analysis scripts and thus it may be necessary to do some swapping
## between filenames or modify the scripts.

make clean
## destroys temporary files very aggressively, beware.

CINT files, with *.C (vs. *.cc used by the makefile):
(run these with 'root -l *.C+' or similar commands)

PLOTTING

runPFSortedJets.C:
## Primary plotting script. Uses the particle flow ordering scheme for the
## different particles.

runSortedJets.C:
## An older version. Graphical stacking is done according to the particle
## type. Usage not adviced, unless it is specially wanted.

runSortedJetsDistr.C:
## Older version, used to inspect pT distributions.

OTHERS:

tdrstyle_*.C are used for the graphical representations

mergeBins.C a small scripts
