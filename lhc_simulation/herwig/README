The code structures for simulating Herwig++ data.

Usage:

Herwig++ read *.in
// The specifics of the simulation are defined in the .in file.
Herwig++ run *.run -N no_of_steps
// This is used for running the simulation that 
// was initialized in the previous step

Preliminary requirements:
To store particle data into .root files, Herwig requires a structure for
the storaging scheme. Here, a basic storage based on the class MinimalEvent is
used. The corresponding shared object has to be in this directory or in
a correct location in Herwig path (more complicated). To build the share object:

make StoreParticles.so

This routine relies heavily on the base makefile in the parent folder, so making
random changes there might cause problems.
