INTRO:

This software collection is designed for simulating collisions at the LHC, 
saving the particle data and processing it to suitable jet data. Simulations are
executed with pythia6/8 or Herwig++.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

USED STATUS CODES:

1: Generic final particles

2: For gamma/Z-jets the stable gammas and Z's, for generic gammas originating from pi0

3: Outgoing hardest subprocess

Not in active use (ghost particles):

4: Ghost partons
5: Ghost s hadron
6: Ghost c hadron
7: Ghost b hadron
8: Ghost t hadron (reserved for future usage)

SETUP:

See installation instructions from the parent folder. ROOT is needed always, and
pythia8 is good to be installed. Pythia6 and Herwig++ are more optional. As of now,
the installation used ROOT 6. This should be compatible with the latest ROOT 5
versions, but there can emerge problems. After the basic simulation sofware
packages are installed, some local configurations have to be made. The compiler
options on a local machine should be defined in 'config.mk'. Choices to be made:

Compiler: 
gcc (g++) should be fine and useful, since also the fortran-based
pythia6 is in use. In principle it is possible to use clang.

CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS: 
Change these if necessary. CXXFLAGS is used with the distinction that it has
c++11 included.

PYTHIA6:
The path of the pythia6 libraries is hardcoded here. It should be changed.

PYTHIA8:
If installed correctly, this command should work out-of-the-box.

FASTJET:
Same as with pythia8, this command should work directly in the command line.

ROOT:
Also this command should work directly regardless of the ROOT version in use.

CINTERPRET:
Fine-tuning between root 6 and root 5. If root 5.xx is used, the current line
should be commented and the commented line should be uncommented. The difference
is that root 5 uses rootcint and root 6 rootcling.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

PYTHIA8: The files used for pythia8 simulations.

Build:
 make pythia8
Run:
 make run_pythia8 NUM_EVT=NNNNN NUM_PROC=X MODE=Y
Note:
 All the parameters are optional, since they are initialized with some reasonable values.
 MODE can be set to 0: generic, 1: dijet, 2: gammajet, 3: Zjet

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

HERWIG++: The files used for herwig simulations.

Build:
 make herwig_read HFILE=(read file name)
Run:
 make run_herwig NUM_EVT=NNNNN NUM_PROC=X MODE=Y HFILE=FFFFF
Note:
 HFILE tells which initial setup is used for Herwig++. This has a good initial value and
 usually does not need to be changed. MODE can be set to 0: generic.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

PYTHIA6: The files used for pythia6 simulations.
Buld:
 make pythia6
Run:
 make run_pythia6 NUM_EVT=NNNNN NUM_PROC=X MODE=Y
Note:
 MODE can be set to 0: generic

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

JETANALYSIS: General jetsorting and analysis

Usage:
 make jetanalysis
Run:
 ./jetanalysis.exe (particle file name) (flavour definition)
Note:
 Flavour definition can be 1 - physics definition or 2 - hadronic definition

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

PTCUT: Detector simulation based on jet sorting

Usage:
 make ptcut
Run:
 ./ptcut.exe (generic particle file name)
Note:
 Other particle data modes than generic are not meaningful for detector simulation

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

EVENTS: Event classes used for storaging data.

Usage:
 The events-folder is portable and can be easily shared. Thus, running
 '.L events/***Event.cpp+' allows to easily load the libraries needed for
 showing different functions present in the event.

Notes:
 These are used automatically by the different programs.

 PrtclEvent should be edited only in extreme cases, since the particle data
 itself consumes massive amounts of space. Other events can be modified more
 lightly. If modifications are to be made, the appropriate branches and data
 variables should be created. Also care should be taken with the programs that
 use the results.
