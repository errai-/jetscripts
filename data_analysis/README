The folders 'analyzer' and 'histplot' contain the most important pieces of code.

The 'analyzer' has some analysis code, which processes raw jet data (detector/simulation)
to readable results. The results are stored as 'cakes' in the pt-eta -plane.

The 'histplot' folder contains plotting functionalities for this 'cakes'.
See README's in the folders for further info. Below is a part of a deprecated version of
this README, might contain something useful.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

AnalyzeData.h, AnalyzeData.C:
Basic analysis of MC/DT/Pythia8 data, makes pT-eta "cakes" that can be sliced according to the needs

AnalyzeHelper.h:
Small helper scripts related to the AnalyzeData class

ProfileBuilder.h:
A class for building the "cake-like" profile, including functions for using it

runAnalyzeData.C:
The actual root script that initiates the usage of AnalyzeData

HistScripts.h:
General small scripts to be used for modifying histograms

ProfileProjector.h:
A class to be used while reading the histogram data stored by AnalyzeData.
Projects the desired part of the "cakes" to a 2D plot.

runDrawHistos.C:
The actual root script that runs ProfileProjector. Includes several pre-defined things that
can be plotted, but also new things for plotting can be included.
By default, this will compare histograms with each other, for instance MC vs. Data.

runSingleHistos.C:
Same as the previous, but here no comparison is done. Only plots of single results.
